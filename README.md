# Boids

My take on the flock simulation [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) originally developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986. Implemented as part of a mandatory assignment in INF-1400 at UiT.

As well as using right mouse click to add boids you can adjust the three factors used in the algorithm as stated below.
